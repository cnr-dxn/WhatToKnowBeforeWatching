# (In Progress) WhatToKnowBeforeWatching.com

A website in which a user can search a movie and find out what there is to know before watching the movie, to allow for them to know key information to understand the plot/film altogether, and therefore assist their overall experience to be much more memorable.

**React-Based**: This application is React-based, to allow for a component-based javascript frontend to build a dynamic web application much easier than using static HTML, CSS and Javascript. Furthermore, ReactJS has a spectacular selection of libraries for quicker and more efficient programming in the long run.

**SQL-Backed Framework**: In order to increase efficiency and scalability, an SQL relational database will be used to back the website itself and store information pertaining to the films, users and other required data. Using this, scripts will be written to autonomously populate the databases later on in development to further the capabilities of the websites.

**Dynamically Generated Pages**: This website is being written as a dynamic web application, and thus generated the pages and provides the data in real time for the user visiting the site. Thus, each user can have a more personalized experience, and the development of more complex components of the website will be easier.

## How to run this application:

This is run as a yarn-based react application, and thus is run as such:
